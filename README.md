# Chicken Invaders Dupe üêîüçó
A dupe for the famous Chicken Invaders game using OpenGL 2D.

This project is a simple 2D shooting game implemented using OpenGL and GLUT. The game involves a player-controlled character and an enemy character, both capable of shooting bullets.

## How to Play

### THE MAIN CHARACTERS
- The **player** character can move up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys.
- The **player** can shoot bullets using the spacebar.
- The **enemy** character moves horizontally back and forth across the screen and shoots bullets periodically.

### How it goes...
- The player starts with 3 lives, and the enemy has 5 health points.
- If the player's bullet hits the enemy, the enemy loses a health point.
- If the enemy's bullet hits the player, the player loses a life.
- The game ends when either the player's lives reach zero or the enemy's health reaches zero, displaying a "game over" message.

### Power-ups
- Power-ups are generated at random intervals and locations on the screen.
- If the player captures a power-up, it activates a special mode (e.g., changing the player's color).
- The power-up has a timer, after which it deactivates if not captured.
